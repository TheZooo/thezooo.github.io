Experimental Website<br>
Welcome! If you got here from my college account, this is where most of my high school code is. Look back on all the poor programming and organizing decisions I made in the past. But hey! We all had to start somewhere. This github website you are on contains miscellaneous browser games and random programs I made in high school. Other repositories include either school projects/assignments or code that I did in my freetime.
